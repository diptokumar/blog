          <p>
            <h1>GARDENING:</h1>Gardening is my hobby. I derive great pleasure from this
            hobby. At the back of my house, there is a small plot of land. It is
            my garden. I grow flowers and some vegetables of the season in this
            plot. Gardening which I thoroughly enjoy and admire. I have a
            natural affinity for the natural environment. Outdoor life is
            unquestionably superior to our urban comforts and luxuries. I like
            to remain indoors only when the weather is excessively hot or cold.
            When the weather is nice and pleasant, however, I hurry out to enjoy
            the fresh air and natural surroundings. <br>
            <br>
             <h1>SINGING:</h1>Signing is another
            favorite hobby of mine. From very little age I have been singing
            songs and learning music. I was a student of CHAYANAUT SHANGEET
            BIDYATAN. My favorite form of music is classical, RABINDRA sangeet.
            Signing gives me mental peace. I feel whenever I am sad, singing
            gives me relief form sorrowing. While I listen to music, I feel
            relax and calm. Singing is an excellent way of entertainment. I like
            to sing because it is fun to sing. I also like to sing because I
            like to sing with my friends. Singing gives me a great pleasure.t
            helps me to forget my daily problems. Every person has his own
            favorite groups or singers. My favorite singers are NACHIKETA, LATA
            MUNGESHKAR. <br>
            <br>
            <h1>TRAVELLING:</h1>Though I don’t travel now that much, but in
            future I want to travel a lot. Travelling is also my favorite hobby.
            Travelling is in my hobby list because travelling, I believe, can
            open a person’s eye. The more a person will see the world the more
            he will get to know things better. Travelling gives me a lot of
            pleasure. I have went to JAPAN, INDIA,THAILAND and different places
            of BANGLADESH.my most favorite destination still now would be
            Japan.in future I have plan to travel the world as much as I can. My
            dream destination is Paris, Switzerland and so on.
