            TRAVEL To travel from one place to another for different purposes is
            generally called travelling. People do not travel always for the
            same purposes. Someone travels to gain knowledge and experience,
            someone travels for pleasure, someone travels for business purposes
            etc. It has much educative value. It is a part of education. Our
            education and book knowledge remain imperfect without travelling. We
            can learn many things from travelling. It teaches us to trade and
            commerce, language, sociology, customs, culture, history, geography
            and so on. Therefore, the educative value of travelling beggars
            description. Besides this, there are some special benefits of
            travelling. If a man stays in one place for a long time, he becomes
            monotonous. Travelling removes our monotony and gives pleasure. It
            also broadens our outlook and refreshes our mind. A good traveler
            can easily educate others. He can give us first-hand knowledge of
            men and matters of another country. I like travelling very much.
